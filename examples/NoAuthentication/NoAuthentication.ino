// Example sketch demonstrating unauthenticated use of the EtherEvent library
// Periodically sends a test event, receives events and prints them to the serial monitor.
// Required the modified TCPEvents plugin for use with EventGhost: https://github.com/per1234/TCPEvents
// Use with the EventGhost-example-trees.

//These libraries are required by EtherEvent:
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#define ETHEREVENT_NO_AUTHENTICATION  //this line must come before #include "EtherEvent.h"
#include "EtherEvent.h"
