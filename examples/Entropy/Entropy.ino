// Example sketch demonstrating use of the Entropy library with EtherEvent.
// Requires Entropy truly random numbers library: http://sites.google.com/site/astudyofentropy/file-cabinet
// The Entropy library is compatible with AVR based boards (such as Uno, Mega, Leonardo, etc), Due, and Teensy
// Periodically sends a test event, receives events and prints them to the serial monitor.
// For use with the EventGhost-example-trees.

//These libraries are required by EtherEvent:
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <utility/w5100.h>  //Used for setting the W5x00 retransmission time and count.
